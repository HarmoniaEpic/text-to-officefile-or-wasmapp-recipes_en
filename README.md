## Please stop! I'm bored!
[Dear Miss Sweetie Poo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ig_Nobel_Prize#Ceremony), please accept this. [I beg you, please give me more time and money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana_Jones#Dr._Nitro) in consideration of the gift below.
<br><br>
[PoC-WAT2WASM-RECIPE.md](PoC-WAT2WASM-RECIPE.md)
<br>
Attach the above file to the AI chat and provide instructions such as: ‚ÄúPlease create a webpage that generates a WASM program listing prime numbers within the integers 0 to 100, based on the attached recipe.‚Äù You will then receive an HTML file or its code, such as the following:
<br>
[prime_numbers_wasm.html](examples/prime_numbers_wasm.html)
## üí£Caution! This product is still PoC!üí£
## üöΩPlease flush away any complaints as this is a proof of conceptüöΩ
## What is this?
If we could prepare something like a Dockerfile for Docker and create desired files on the browser's sandbox, it would surely be convenient. With the advancement of [SLM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/small-language-models) and context window size, it should be possible to run on edge devices too.
<BR><BR>
This repository is the result of shaping the above idea to a working stage using AI. While it seems reasonably useful even at this stage, please feel free to modify it according to your use and needs.
<BR><BR>
We plan to make careful corrections with human review once the operation stabilizes.

<details>
<summary><b>Memo + A few grumbles</b></summary>

- First of all, we need to fix the hyperbolic writing style. Lies, exaggerations, and misleading content are not good.
- Another point is the need to remove duplicate code. It seems that having AI repeatedly modify code causes strange fragments to accumulate.
- Also, unnecessary feature additions. There are cases where it adds half-baked features that weren't requested and destabilizes the code, so we can't let our guard down.
- Regarding Claude, if you don't mandate date retrieval at the beginning of work using projects etc., it tends to put unclear dates in the update history. My instance seems particularly devoted to January 2025.

</details>

## What we can do now with our current recipe
### Browser Sandbox + Python (using Pyodide)
- Generation of Office files (docx, xlsx, pptx, pdf)
- Generation of mathematical formula PNG images (TeX-style mathematical formulas using matplotlib)
### Browser Sandbox + WASM (using AssemblyScript)
- Generation of WASM-optimized standalone HTML web apps
## ‚ö†Ô∏èAbout local execution of recipes‚ö†Ô∏è
Contrary to the description in AI-generated text, when actually tested, recipes consistently failed to execute on models running on video cards with 16GB VRAM. It seems that model size is an important limiting factor in addition to context window length.
<br><br>
We're considering verifying this on Colab etc. in the future. It might take time, but inferencing heavyweight models on CPU might also work. Other possibilities include Apple Silicon Macs.

-> It looks promising. With CPU execution, **gpt-oss:20b** produced outputs close to correct. **qwen2.5-coder:32b**, or models with larger parameter counts, are likely to handle more complex recipes.

## Configuration Comparison between Recipe System and Docker System
**üìä Comparison Table**
| Aspect | Recipe System | Docker |
|------|--------------|---------|
| **Recipe File** | MD File (Markdown) | Dockerfile (Dedicated DSL) |
| **Execution Process** | AI -> HTML -> Browser -> WASM | Build -> Image -> Container |
| **Execution Location** | Client (Browser) | Server/Local (OS) |
| **Processing Engine** | WebAssembly (Pyodide/AssemblyScript) | Native Process |
| **Distribution Unit** | Single HTML File | Container Image |
| **Dependencies** | CDN Dynamic Loading | Included at Image Build |
| **Isolation Method** | Browser Sandbox | Namespace/Cgroup |
| **Network** | CORS Restrictions | Full Access Available |
| **Data Persistence** | File Download | Volume/Bind Mount |
| **Application Field** | Document and Web App Generation, and Many Others | General Applications |
## Possibilities of Recipe + AI + WebAssembly
This recipe system has the following characteristics:
<br>
- Realizes on the browser side what Docker does on the server side
- Constructs solutions on the browser by instructing AI what you want to do in natural language
- Literally provides AI with a ‚Äúsandbox‚Äù
<br>
The above three points are its characteristics. Functions that cannot be realized by AI alone can be achieved by simply outputting HTML based on the premise of building a development environment on the browser sandbox using Pyodide, AssemblyScript, etc., making it an extremely easy and flexible means of expanding AI functionality. As more things become possible with WASI and WASI Sockets, with some ingenuity, it might become possible to have AI design and create an MCP server for a specific purpose on the browser and use it via a proxy server. "Computer Use Anywhere" might not be a dream.
